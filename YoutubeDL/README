Before you start, you need to install youtube-dl.

Two ways to achieve this (SUSE Linux):
1.) pip install youtube-dl
2.) zypper install youtube-dl

And that is it, place this directory in your document root folder. Normally located in:
/srv/www/htdocs/

Then in your browser, navigate to http://[your-server-ip]/YoutubeDL
